This Valentine's Day, I'm sharing something I've been building with love. ❤️

Built for those who share a love for React and design systems.

Introducing **React Scanner Studio** — a portable, interactive dashboard for analyzing React component usage across your codebase.

If you've ever found yourself asking:
→ Which components are actually being used?
→ What props are passed most frequently?
→ Is our design system being adopted consistently?
→ Are there props defined but never used?
→ Which components are ripe for deprecation?
→ How do teams across the org use the same component differently?
→ What's the impact of migrating or deprecating a component?

React Scanner Studio gives you the answers — beautifully visualized and ready to drive decisions.

**What it does:**
📊 Transforms raw scan data into an interactive dashboard
📦 Generates static files you can host anywhere
⚡ Zero config setup — get started in seconds
🔧 CI/CD ready for automated reporting

Whether you're maintaining a design system, planning a migration, or just curious about your component landscape — this tool is for you.

**Get started:**

```
npx react-scanner-studio init
npx react-scanner-studio start
```
